    <h2> Window Event </h2>
    <div id="box">
        On August 23, 2023, Indian became the first nation in the world to successfully perform a soft landing on the
        lunar south pole with Chandrayaan-3. In another first, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is gearing
        up for its first crewed Indian space mission, Gaganyaan.

        During his trip to the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, Prime Minister Narendra Modi
        on Tuesday announced the names of the astronauts set to crew the spacecraft, all of whom hold ranks as either
        wing commanders or group captains in the Indian Air Force (IAF) and boast significant experience as test pilots.
        What is the Gaganyaan mission?
        The Gaganyaan project aims to send a team of astronauts into space, orbiting 400 km above Earth for a three-day
        mission, and safely return them by landing in the Indian Ocean. According to ISRO, the key elements needed for
        the Gaganyaan mission include developing critical technologies like a safe launch vehicle for astronauts, a life
        support system to keep them comfortable in space, a way for the crew to escape in case of emergency, and plans
        for their training, recovery, and medical care.

        The Gaganyaan project, named after the Sanskrit term for a vehicle to the sky, has been developed with an
        investment of $1 billion, according to the BBC. Its success would mark India as the fourth nation to achieve
        human spaceflight capability, following Russia, the US and China.

        Vehicle carrying astronauts to space
        The renowned Indian LVM3 rocket, previously utilised for the Chandrayaan-3 mission, will serve as the launch
        vehicle for the Gaganyaan mission. It comprises solid, liquid and cryogenic stages. All systems within the LVM3
        launcher are being reconfigured specifically for the mission to meet human requirements, now designated as the
        Human Rated LVM3 (HLVM3). According to ISRO, HLVM3 will have the capability to launch the Orbital Module into
        the intended Low Earth Orbit of 400 km.

        Who is part of the Gaganyaan mission?
        The prime minister announced the names of the astronauts who are a part of the Gaganyaan mission, during an
        event held in Thiruvananthapuram, where the four officers were hailed as "dreamers, adventurers, and courageous
        individuals preparing for space exploration". Hailing from the Indian Air Force, they are Group Captain
        Prashanth Balakrishnan Nair, Group Captain Ajit Krishnan, Group Captain Angad Pratap, and Wing Commander
        Shubhanshu Shukla. Only three of these four pilots will eventually go to space as part of the mission.

        Prime Minister Modi and ISRO chief S Somanath adorned their shirts with badges featuring golden wings, with the
        former calling them "India's pride". The chosen men are Air Force pilots who have been selected after undergoing
        extensive physical and psychological evaluations. Having completed a rigorous , 13-month training in Russia,
        they are now continuing their training in India.

        Technology and Training for the Gaganyaan mission
        Accorsing to ISRO, ensuring human safety is the top priority for the Gaganyaan mission. To achieve this goal, a
        range of new technologies, including engineering systems and human-centric systems, are being developed and
        implemented.

        In Bengaluru, the Astronaut Training Facility offers classroom instruction, physical fitness routines, simulator
        exercises, and flight suit training for the pilots. Training modules encompass academic courses, Gaganyaan
        Flight Systems, familiarisation with microgravity through Parabolic Flights, aero-medical training, recovery and
        survival techniques, mastery of flight procedures, and training on Crew Training Simulators. Aero-medical
        training, regular flying practice, and yoga sessions are also integral components of the training programme.

        Potential Challenges to the mission
        ISRO has highlighted its primary objectives of a safe launch vehicle for the astronauts, a life support system
        to keep them comfortable in space, and a way for the crew to escape in case of emergency, but there remain
        potential challenges for the human space mission, which can include:
        An increasing threat of space debris in the low Earth orbits which can result in depressurisation of the cabin
        of the crew module in case of a collision with small debris.
        Creating a replica of Earth-like conditions inside a small crew module poses a big challenge as creating an
        actual operating environment for humans for an outer space mission is next to impossible.
        Due to the limitation of carrying much weight into space, a regenerative environment for food, water, oxygen,
        carbon-dioxide and human waste has to be developed which can be a challenge.
